## üìã MAIN TOPICS DISCUSSED

### 1. **Background & Business Context** ‚è±Ô∏è 0:28 - 6:25
- Why licensing system is needed (Veolia takeover in ~1 year)
- Problem: A-Stack will lose access to environment
- Need to track site usage for billing (HWF + Boost sites)
- Requirement: Quarterly licensing calculation
- Goal: Avoid charging for configuration/testing sites
- Limit: ~12 Veolia configuration users
- Challenge: Hard to determine configuration vs production transition

### 2. **System Architecture** ‚è±Ô∏è 6:25 - 8:22
- **Generic reusable component** (not HWF-specific)
- License server design - 7 core APIs needed
- Site key structure: HWF ‚Üî License Server communication
- Automated provisioning flow (no manual intervention)

### 3. **Key Types: Dev vs Production** ‚è±Ô∏è 8:22 - 14:00
- **Production keys**: All HWF sites (automatic)
- **Dev keys**: Only from Boost when explicitly requested
- Plant states: basic, commissioning, active (all production for HWF)
- HWF admin vs Enterprise admin distinction
- User counting and privacy considerations

### 4. **Key Refresh & Security** ‚è±Ô∏è 14:00 - 18:14
- Monthly key refresh required (Alex's requirement)
- Security rationale: Keys must not be constant
- Client-triggered refresh flow
- AWS Secrets Manager requirement for HWF side
- License server storage options (flexible)

### 5. **Enforcement & Validation** ‚è±Ô∏è 18:14 - 22:57
- Who enforces: HWF side only
- Validation method: Token-based with caching
- Call home mechanism (periodic)
- Invalid key behavior: Block access, send alert
- Same behavior as current Boost-to-HWF

### 6. **Boost Integration** ‚è±Ô∏è 22:57 - 32:20
- Two-tier API key system (application + site level)
- Create Boost Dashboard API modification
- Update API Key endpoint (dev ‚Üî production)
- Application-level key for Boost authentication
- Monthly refresh integration

### 7. **Enterprise & Site Management** ‚è±Ô∏è 32:20 - 38:18
- Chain of trust: Root ‚Üí Org ‚Üí Enterprise ‚Üí Site
- Enterprise-level keys required (even with proxy sites only)
- Commissioning sites counted separately
- Proxy sites NOT counted
- Duplicate site IDs handled

### 8. **Stats & Privacy** ‚è±Ô∏è 38:18 - 42:31
- Quarterly manifest content
- HWF admin info: Names + emails (full disclosure)
- Enterprise admin, plant users: Counts only
- Enterprise names: NOT included (privacy)
- Internal users (A-Stack employees) counted as HWF admins
- Transition to Veolia in ~1 year

### 9. **Implementation Planning** ‚è±Ô∏è 42:31 - 48:22
- Team: Nancy, An, Long (not available yet)
- Deliverables: Requirements doc + Design doc
- Timeline: Review by end of day Wednesday
- Tasks assigned: Nancy updates requirements, An creates design
- Alok approval needed before implementation
- ETA to be provided

## üéØ KEY DECISIONS MADE

### Architecture
1. ‚úÖ Generic reusable component (not HWF-specific)
2. ‚úÖ Automated workflows (no manual intervention)
3. ‚úÖ Token-based validation with caching
4. ‚úÖ HWF side enforcement only

### Key Management
5. ‚úÖ Monthly refresh mandatory (security)
6. ‚úÖ Dev keys only from Boost (explicit request)
7. ‚úÖ Enterprise-level keys required in chain
8. ‚úÖ AWS Secrets Manager for HWF side

### Business Rules
9. ‚úÖ Quarterly billing model
10. ‚úÖ Configuration sites not billed (dev keys)
11. ‚úÖ Proxy sites not counted
12. ‚úÖ Commissioning sites counted separately

### Privacy & Reporting
13. ‚úÖ Aggregate counts only (privacy)
14. ‚úÖ HWF admin contact info included
15. ‚úÖ Enterprise names excluded
16. ‚úÖ Internal users counted as HWF admins

### Technical
17. ‚úÖ 7 core API endpoints identified
18. ‚úÖ Two-tier key system for Boost
19. ‚úÖ Update API for dev ‚Üî production transition
20. ‚úÖ Watermark for dev keys (future requirement)

## üí° CRITICAL INSIGHTS

### Problem Understanding
- Veolia will manage environment independently in ~1 year
- No longer have access to track site usage directly
- Need automated license tracking and enforcement
- Quarterly billing based on production sites only

### Solution Approach
- Build once, use everywhere (generic component)
- Automatic provisioning and validation
- Monthly key refresh for security
- Quarterly stats reporting
- Dev vs production key distinction

### Business Alignment
- Track production sites accurately
- Don't charge for configuration/testing
- Support Veolia's full-service model
- Future-proof for environment takeover

### Technical Requirements
- 7 API endpoints minimum
- AWS Secrets Manager integration
- Token-based validation
- Automatic enforcement
- Privacy-compliant reporting
