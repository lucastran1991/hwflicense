## ✅ COMPLETED TASKS

### Task #1: Organization Key Management ✅
**Implementation Date:** October 27, 2025

**What Was Built:**
- ✅ AES-256-GCM encryption functions (`backend/pkg/crypto/encryption.go`)
- ✅ Org key repository with CRUD operations
- ✅ Enhanced key generation utility
- ✅ Configuration for encryption password

**Key Features:**
- AES-256-GCM authenticated encryption
- PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
- Random salt (32 bytes) and nonce (12 bytes) per encryption
- Private keys never stored in plaintext

**Usage:**
```bash
go run cmd/genkeys/main.go org test_org_001 dev
```

**Files:**
- `backend/pkg/crypto/encryption.go` (NEW)
- `backend/internal/repository/org_keys_repository.go` (NEW)
- `backend/internal/config/config.go` (MODIFIED)
- `backend/cmd/genkeys/main.go` (MODIFIED)

### Task #2: Site License Signing ✅
**Implementation Date:** October 27, 2025

**What Was Built:**
- ✅ Real ECDSA P-256 signatures (removed ALL TODOs!)
- ✅ Signature chain verification (Root → CML → Site)
- ✅ 30-day grace period for expired licenses
- ✅ Fingerprint matching logic

**Key Features:**
- Real cryptographic signatures throughout
- Chain of trust: Root → CML → Site license
- Expiration checks with 30-day grace period
- Optional fingerprint validation

**Before:**
```go
signature := "TODO: sign with org key"
```

**After:**
```go
signature, err := crypto.SignJSON(licenseData, privateKey)
// Real ECDSA P-256 signature
```

- `backend/internal/service/site_service.go` (MODIFIED)
- `backend/pkg/crypto/crypto.go` (MODIFIED)

### Task #3: Manifest Signing & A-Stack ✅
**Implementation Date:** October 27, 2025

**What Was Built:**
- ✅ Real ECDSA signatures for manifests
- ✅ HTTP client with exponential backoff retry
- ✅ Complete Mock A-Stack server
- ✅ Signature validation in mock server

**Key Features:**
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s
- Max 3 retry attempts
- 10-second timeout per request
- Mock A-Stack validates signatures

**Before:**
```go
signature := "TODO: sign with org key"
// TODO: Send to A-Stack endpoint
```

**After:**
```go
signature, err := crypto.SignJSON(manifestData, privateKey)
err = sendToAStackWithRetry(endpoint, payload)
// Real signing and HTTP delivery
```

**What Was Built:**
- ✅ Site details page (`frontend/app/dashboard/sites/[id]/page.tsx`)
- ✅ Download license functionality
- ✅ Fingerprint input fields
- ✅ Manifest preview modal
- ✅ Send to A-Stack button

**New Features:**

   - Signature verification status
   - Download and revoke buttons

2. **Enhanced Sites Page**
   - Fingerprint input fields (address, dns_suffix, deployment_tag)
   - Download license button for each site
   - Better form handling

3. **Enhanced Manifests Page**
   - View manifest details in modal
   - Send to A-Stack button
   - Manifest preview with formatted JSON
   - Signature display

**Files:**
- `frontend/app/dashboard/sites/[id]/page.tsx` (NEW)

## 🎯 REMAINING OPTIONAL TASKS

### Task #5: PostgreSQL Migration (Optional)
**Priority:** Medium  
**Reason:** SQLite works perfectly for Hub operators  
**When Needed:** Before large-scale production deployment

**What it would include:**
- PostgreSQL schema with UUID types
- Connection pooling (10-25 connections)
- Data migration script (SQLite → PostgreSQL)
- Support for both databases

**Current Status:** SQLite works great for development and small deployments

### Task #6: Comprehensive Testing (Optional)
**Priority:** Medium  
**Reason:** Manual testing completed successfully  
**When Needed:** For CI/CD pipeline and production confidence

**What it would include:**
- Unit tests for crypto operations
- Integration tests for services
- E2E tests for workflows
- Frontend component tests

**Current Status:** System has been manually tested and verified working
