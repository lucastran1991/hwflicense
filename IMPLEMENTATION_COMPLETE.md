## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Generate Org Keys
```bash
cd backend
go run cmd/genkeys/main.go org test_org_001 dev
go run cmd/genkeys/main.go org test_org_001 prod
```

### 2. Start Backend Server
```bash
cd backend
go run cmd/server/main.go
```

### 3. Start Mock A-Stack
```bash
cd backend  
go run cmd/astack-mock/main.go
```

### 4. Create Site License (with real signature)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/sites/create \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"site_id":"site_001","fingerprint":{"address":"192.168.1.1"}}'

# Returns: Real ECDSA signature (not TODO placeholder!)
```

### 5. Generate and Send Manifest
```bash
# Generate manifest (with real signature)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/manifests/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"period":"2024-01"}'

# Send to A-Stack (with retry logic)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/manifests/send \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"manifest_id":"...","astack_endpoint":"http://localhost:8081/api/manifests/receive"}'
```
